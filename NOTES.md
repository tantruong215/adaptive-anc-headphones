# Development Notes – Adaptive ANC Headphones

**June 6, 2025**  
Repo created and structured. Defined signal chain for ANC system: mic preamps → STM32F7 → LMS filter → headphones. Reading up on adaptive DSP filter stability.

To Do Next:
- Build LMS prototype in MATLAB
- Outline IIR filter block in STM32Cube
- Choose audio ADC interface (I2S or PDM)
