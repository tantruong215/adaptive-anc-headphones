# TODO â€“ Adaptive ANC Headphones

- [ ] Design audio signal chain with dual MEMS microphones
- [ ] Write LMS adaptive filter in Python or MATLAB for testing
- [ ] Choose STM32 dev board and start STM32CubeMX project
- [ ] Set up ADC input and headphone output (I2S or PWM)
- [ ] Implement real-time filtering with minimal delay
- [ ] Begin tuning ANC response in real-world environments
